Quality Assurance (QA) Deviation Log Summary

Deviation Event Summary: Batch C-0985 (Door Seal Failure)
Batch C-0985, initiated on March 14th, 2024, resulted in a critical process deviation. At 35 minutes into the 60-minute bake cycle, the Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) model generated a T^2 alarm signifying a major process drift. The contributing variables showed an anomalous drop in Oven_Temp_Actual and a corresponding cessation in the rate of temperature increase in the Batter_Center_Temp. The Root Cause Analysis (RCA) confirmed a temporary failure in the oven door's primary seal, leading to significant heat loss. Despite corrective action (manual door resealing), the predicted Final_Height dropped to 6.9 cm (below the specification of 7.5 cm), rendering the entire batch Scrap due to low quality and inconsistent internal structure. This failure led directly to the creation of CAPA-2024-F12, mandating scheduled quarterly pressure testing on all oven door seals.

Standard QA Process for Deviation Reporting
The Quality Assurance (QA) protocol for any flagged deviation requires strict adherence to SOP-QA-002. Upon an MSPC alert, the operator must immediately isolate the batch and log the event in the LIMS system. A major deviation is classified if the predicted CQA falls outside the 95% confidence interval established by the PLS model. The subsequent Deviation Report must include the Batch ID, the precise timestamp of the alarm, a narrative from the operator, and a confirmation of the primary deviating tag (e.g., Oven_Temp_Actual). All reports are reviewed by the QA manager within 24 hours. If the deviation's cause is mechanical or procedural, the case is escalated to a CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) team for formal resolution, retraining, or equipment maintenance. The goal is continuous process verification, ensuring that deviations highlight areas for process improvement, not just compliance failure.

Example of Previous CAPA Implementation
The issue of "Under-Mixed Batter" leading to inconsistent curing (as reflected in Fault Code MECH_FAILURE_M03) was addressed under CAPA-2023-B07. The RCA determined that the stirrer's torque sensor was occasionally providing false readings, causing the PLC to halt the mixing sequence prematurely. The resolution involved upgrading the sensor hardware and updating SOP-B-005 to include a 15-minute manual visual inspection of batter homogeneity. The goal of using the GenAI Copilot is to ensure that operators adhere to this new SOP immediately upon detecting the MECH_FAILURE_M03 signature, preventing the costly outcome of a scrap batch.
