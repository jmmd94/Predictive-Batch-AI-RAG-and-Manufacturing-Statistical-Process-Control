Normal,STATUS_OK,Process running within Golden Batch specifications.,Continue monitoring process parameters. Log successful batch completion at T=60 minutes.,SOP-QA-001
Door_Open,TEMP_EXCUR_F20,Significant heat loss due to process interruption (Oven Door opened/failed seal). Batter core temperature is critically delayed.,Initiate emergency bake time extension (SOP-B1) and manually recalibrate oven temp to 185Â°C for remaining 15 minutes to attempt salvage.,SOP-B-005
Under_Mixed_Batter,MECH_FAILURE_M03,"Mechanical issue in the mixing sequence caused heterogeneous material density, resulting in inconsistent heat transfer and uneven curing.","Immediately isolate the batch for inspection. If purity prediction remains below 96.0%, abort the batch and initiate cleaning cycle per SOP-C-010.",SOP-QA-003
