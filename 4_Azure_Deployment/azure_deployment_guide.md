Azure Deployment Guide: Predictive Batch AI POC
This guide outlines the proposed architecture and deployment steps for the Predictive Batch AI solution using Microsoft Azure services. The goal is to transform local Python models and CSV knowledge bases into an orchestrated, real-time web service.

1.  Architecture Overview
The solution follows a modern Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) architecture:
- Data Ingestion: Synthetic data (.csv files) are uploaded to Azure Storage.
- Model Deployment (Inference): Trained PCA/PLS models are deployed as secure endpoints.
- Knowledge Base (RAG): SOP and CAPA knowledge is indexed for reliable retrieval.
- Orchestration & UI: Azure Function or Logic App monitors the process, calls the model endpoint, and feeds the result to a GenAI LLM for final action.

 .pkl | pca_model.pklpls_model.pklscaler_model.pkl  
.csv.txt SOP_knowledge.csvqa_deviation_reports.txt 

3. High-Level Deployment Steps
âœ… Deploy Storage
Create an Azure Storage account and upload all files from:
- 1_Data_Generation
- 3_GenAI_Knowledge_Base
âœ… Deploy Models
Package the Python logic from simulate_genai_trigger.py (excluding local loading code) and the three .pkl files into a Docker container. Deploy this container as an Azure ML Real-time Endpoint.
âœ… Configure RAG
Set up Azure AI Search to index:
- SOP_knowledge.csv
- qa_deviation_reports.txt
âœ… Create Orchestrator
Build an Azure Function that runs every few minutes to simulate real-time monitoring:
- Reads new data
- Calls the Azure ML endpoint
- Calls the RAG system
- Synthesizes the final alert message using Azure OpenAI, grounded by Azure AI Search
âœ… Final Output (UI Integration)
The Azure Function delivers the final structured alert (similar to simulate_genai_trigger.py output) to an end system such as:
- Microsoft Teams
- A dedicated web UI (e.g., React Copilot Dashboard)
